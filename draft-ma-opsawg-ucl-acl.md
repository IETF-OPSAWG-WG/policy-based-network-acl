--- abstract

   This document defines a YANG module for policy-based network access
   control, which provides consistent and efficient enforcement of
   network access control policies based on group identity.  Moreover, this document defines a mechanism to ease the maintenance
   of the mapping between a user group identifier and a set of IP/MAC addresses
   to enforce policy-based network access control.

   Also, the document defines a common schedule YANG module which is
   designed to be applicable for policy activation based on date and
   time conditions.

   In addition, the document defines a RADIUS attribute that is used to
   communicate the user group identifier as part of identification and
   authorization information.

# Introduction {#intro}

   With the increased adoption of remote access technologies (e.g.,
   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)) and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
   policies, enterprises adopted more flexibility related to how, where,
   and when employees work and collaborate.  However, more flexibility
   comes with increased risks.  Enabling office flexibility (e.g.,
   mobility across many access locations) introduces a set of challenges
   for large-scale enterprises compared to conventional network access management approaches.
   Examples of such challenges are listed below:

   *  Endpoints do not have a stable IP address.  For example, Wireless
      LAN (WLAN) and VPN clients, as well as back-end Virtual Machine
      (VM)-based servers, can move; their IP addresses could change as a
      result.  This means that relying on IP/transport fields (e.g., the
      5-tuple) is inadequate to ensure consistent and efficient security
      policy enforcement.  IP address-based policies may not be flexible
      enough to accommodate endpoints with volatile IP addresses.

   *  With the massive adoption of teleworking, there is now a need to
      apply different security policies to the same set of users under
      different circumstances (e.g., prevent relaying attacks against a
      local attachment point to the Enterprise network).  For example,
      network access might be granted based upon criteria such as users'
      access location, source network reputation, users' role, time-of-
      day, type of network device used (e.g., corporate issued device
      versus personal device), device's security posture, etc.  This
      means the network needs to recognize the users' identity and their
      current context, and map the users to their correct access
      entitlement to the network.

   This document defines a common schedule YANG module in {{sec-schedule}} which
   is designed to be applicable for policy activation based on date and time
   conditions. This model is designed with the intent to be reusable in other
   scheduling contexts.

   {{sec-UCL}} defines a YANG module for policy-based network access control,
   which extends the IETF Access Control Lists (ACLs) module defined in {{!RFC8519}}.
   This module can be used to ensure consistent enforcement of ACL policies
   based on the group identity.

   The ACL notion has been generalized to be device-nonspecific, and can be
   defined at network/administrative domain level {{?I-D.dbb-netmod-acl}}. To
   allow for all applications of ACLs, the YANG module for policy-based network
   access control defined in {{sec-UCL}} does not limit how it can be used.

   This document also defines a mechanism to establish a mapping between the
   user group identifier (ID) and common IP packet header fields and other
   encapsulating packet data (e.g., MAC address) to execute the policy-based access control.

   Additionally, the document defines a Remote Authentication Dial-in
   User Service (RADIUS) {{!RFC2865}} attribute that is used to
   communicate the user group identifier as part of identification and
   authorization information ({{sec-radius}}).

   Although the document cites MAC address as an example in some sections, the
   document does not make an assumption about which identifiers are used to trigger ACLs.
   These examples should not be considered as recommendations. Readers should be
   aware that MAC-based ACLs can be bypassed by flushing out the MAC address.
   Other implications related to the change of MAC addresses are discussed in
   {{?I-D.ietf-madinas-use-cases}}.

   The YANG data models in this document conform to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in {{!RFC8342}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

   The meanings of the symbols in tree diagrams are defined in
   {{?RFC8340}}.

   The document uses the following definitions and acronyms defined in {{!RFC8519}}:

   * ACE

   * ACL

   The follow term are used throughout this document:

   * User group based ACL (UCL): A YANG data model for policy-based network access
     control that specifies an extension to the IETF ACL model defined in RFC 8519.
     It allows policy enforcement based on the group identity, which can be used
     both at the network device level and at the network/administrative domain level.

   In this document, the term "endpoint" refers to a host device or end user
   that actually connects to a network. Host device refers to servers, IoTs
   and other devices owned by the enterprise.

#  Sample Usage

   Access to some networks (e.g., Enterprise networks) requires to
   recognize the usersâ€™ identities no matter how, where, and when they
   connect to the network resources.  Then, the network maps the
   (connecting) users to their access authorization rights.  Such rights
   are defined following local policies.  As discussed in {{intro}},
   because (1) there is a large number of users and (2) a user may have different
   source IP addresses in different network segments,
   deploying a network access control policy for each IP address or
   network segment is a heavy workload.  An alternate approach is to
   configure endpoint groups to classify users and enterprise devices
   and associate ACLs with endpoint groups so that endpoints in each
   group can share a group of ACL rules.  This approach greatly reduces
   the workload of the administrators and optimizes the ACL resources.

   The Network ACLs (NACLs) can be provisioned on devices using specific
   mechanisms, such as {{!RFC8519}} or {{?I-D.dbb-netmod-acl}}.

   NACL policies may need to vary over time.  For
   example, companies may restrict (or grant) employees access to specific
   internal or external resources during work hours,
   while another policy is adopted during off-hours and weekends.  A
   network administrator may also require to enforce traffic shaping
   (Section 2.3.3.3 of {{?RFC2475}}) and policing (Section 2.3.3.4 of
   {{?RFC2475}}) during peak hours in order not to affect other data
   services.

#  Policy-based Network Access Control

##  Overview {#overview}

   The architecture of a system that provides real-time and consistent
   enforcement of access control policies is shown in {{arch}} and
   includes the following functional entities and interfaces.

   *  A Service Orchestrator which coordinates the overall service,
      including security policies.  The service may be connectivity or
      any other resources that can be hosted and offered by a network.

   *  An SDN controller which is responsible for maintaining endpoint-group
      based ACLs and mapping the endpoint-group to the associated
      attributes information (e.g., IP/MAC address).  An SDN controller
      also behaves as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) {{?RFC3198}} and pushes
      the required access control policies to relevant Policy
      Enforcement Points (PEPs).  A PDP is also known as
      "policy server" {{?RFC2753}}.

      An SDN controller may interact with an Authentication,
      Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server or a Network Access Server (NAS).

   *  A Network Access Server (NAS) entity which handles authentication
      requests.  The NAS interacts with an AAA server to complete user
      authentication using protocols like RADIUS {{!RFC2865}}. When access is granted, the AAA
      server provides the group identifier (group ID) to which the user
      belongs when the user first logs onto the network. A new RADIUS attribute
      is defined in {{sec-radius}} for this purpose.

   *  The AAA server provides a collection of authentication, authorization,
      and accounting functions. The AAA server is responsible for centralized user
      information management. The AAA server is preconfigured with user
      credentials (e.g., user name and password), possible group identities
      and related user attributes (users may be divided into different
      groups based on different user attributes).

   *  The Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) {{?RFC3198}} is the central entity
      which is responsible for enforcing appropriate access control
      policies.  In some cases, a PEP may map incoming packets to their
      associated source or destination endpoint-group IDs, and acts on
      the endpoint-group ID based ACL policies, e.g., an NAS as the PEP
      or a group identifier could be carried in packet header (see
      Section 6.2.3 in {{?I-D.ietf-nvo3-encap}}).  While in other cases,
      the SDN controller maps the group ID to the related common packet
      header and delivers IP/MAC address based ACL policies to the
      required PEPs.

      Multiple PEPs may be involved in a network.

      A PEP exposes a NETCONF interface to the SDN controller {{!RFC6241}}.

   {{arch}} provides the overall architecture and procedure for policy-
   based access control management.

{: #arch title="An Architecture for Group-based Policy Management" artwork-align="center"}

   In reference to {{arch}}, the following typical flow is experienced:

   Step 1:  Administrators (or the Orchestrator) configure an SDN
      controller with network-level ACLs using the YANG module defined
      in {{sec-UCL}}. An example of this is provided in {{controller-ucl}}.

   Step 2:  When a user first logs onto the network, the user is
      required to be authenticated (e.g., using user name and password)
      at the NAS.

   Step 3:  The authentication request is then relayed to the AAA server
      using a protocol such as RADIUS {{!RFC2865}}. It is assumed that the
      AAA server has been appropriately configured to store user credentials,
      e.g., user name, password, group information and other user attributes.
      If the authentication request succeeds, the user is placed in a
      user group the identity of which is returned to the network access server
      as the authentication result (see {{sec-radius}}).
      If the authentication fails, the user is not assigned any user
      group, which also means that the user has no access; or the user
      is assigned a special group with very limited access permissions
      for the network (as a function of the local policy). ACLs are
      enforced so that flows from that IP address are discarded
      (or rate-limited) by the network.  In some implementations, AAA
      server can be integrated with an SDN controller.

   Step 4:  Either the AAA server or the NAS notifies the SDN controller
      of the mapping between the user group ID and related common packet
      header attributes (e.g., IP/MAC address).

   Step 5:  Either group or IP/MAC address based access control policies
      are maintained on relevant PEPs under the SDN controller's management.
      Whether the PEP enforces the group or IP/MAC address based ACL is
      implementation specific. Both types of ACL policy may exist on
      the PEP. {{PEP-ucl}} and {{PEP-acl}} elaborate on each case.

##  Endpoint Group

###  User Group

   The user group is determined by a set of predefined policy criteria
   (e.g., source IP address, geolocation data, time of day, or device certificate).
   It uses an identifier (user group ID) to represent the collective identity of
   a group of users. Users may be moved to different user-groups if their
   composite attributes, environment, and/or local enterprise policy change.


   A user is authenticated, and classified at the AAA server, and
   assigned to a user group.  A user's group membership may change as
   aspects of the user change.  For example, if the user group
   membership is determined solely by the source IP address, then a
   given user's group ID will change when the user moves to a new
   IP address that falls outside of the range of addresses of the
   previous user group.

   This document does not make any assumption about how user groups are
   defined.  Such considerations are deployment specific and are out of
   scope.  However, and for illustration purposes, {{ug-example}} shows
   an example of how user group definitions may be characterized. User
   groups may share several common criteria.  That is, user group
   criteria are not mutually exclusive.  For example, the policy
   criteria of user groups R&D Regular and R&D BYOD may share the same
   set of users that belong to the R&D organization, and differ only in
   the type of clients (firm-issued clients vs. users' personal
   clients).  Likewise, the same user may be assigned to different user
   groups depending on the time of day or the type of day (e.g.,
   weekdays versus weekends), etc.

| Group Name | Group ID | Group Role |
| R&D        |     10     |  R&D employees                 |
| R&D BYOD   |     11     |  Personal devices of R&D employees |
| Sales      |     20     |  Sales employees               |
| VIP        |     30     |  VIP employees                 |
{: #ug-example title='User Group Example'}


###  Device Group

   The device-group ID is an identifier that represents the collective
   identity of a group of enterprise end devices.  An enterprise device
   could be a server that hosts applications or software that deliver
   services to enterprise users.  It could also be an enterprise IoT
   device that serve a limited purpose, e.g., a printer that allows
   users to scan, print and send emails. {{dg-example}} shows an example
   of how device-group definitions may be characterized.

   | Group Name | Group ID | Group Type |
   | Workflow   |     40     |  Workflow  resource servers   |
   | R&D Resource |     50     | R&D resource servers |
   |Sales Resource|     54     | Sales resource servers |
   {: #dg-example title='Device-Group Example'}


   Users accessing an enterprise device should be strictly controlled.
   Matching abstract device group ID instead of specified addresses in
   ACL polices helps shield the consequences of address change (e.g.,
   back-end Virtual Machine (VM)-based server migration).

#  Modules Overview

##  The Schedule YANG Module

   This module defines a common schedule YANG module.  It is inspired
   from the "period of time" and "recurrence rule" format defined in
   {{?RFC5545}}.

   This module is defined as a standalone module rather than as part of the UCL
   with the intention that the time/date definition can be reused.

   {{schedule-tree}} provides an overview of the tree structure of the "ietf-
   schedule" module.

~~~~
{::include ./yang/ietf-schedule-tree.txt}
~~~~
{: #schedule-tree title="Schedule Tree Structure" artwork-align="center"}

   The "period-of-time" allows a time period to be represented using either a start
   and end date and time, or a start and a positive duration of time.

   The "recurrence" allows an indication of the repeat scheduling of an event. The
   repetition can be scoped by a specified end time or by a count of occurences,
   and the frequency identifies the type of recurrence rule. For example, a "daily"
   frequency value specifies repeating events based on an interval of a day or more.
   The interval represents at which intervals the recurrence rule repeats. For example,
   within a daily recurrence rule, an interval value of "8" means every eight days.

   An array of the bysecond/byminute/byhour specifies a list of seconds within a minute/
   minutes within an hour/hours of the day.

   The parameter byday specifies a list of days of
   the week, with a optional direction indicates the nth orrurance of a specific day within
   the "monthly" or "yearly" frequency. For example, within a "monthly" rule,
   the weekday with a value of "monday" and the direction with a value of "-1"
   represents the last Monday of the month.

   An array of the bymonthday/byyearday/byyearweek/byyearmonth specifies a list of
   days of the month/days of the year/weeks of the year/months of the year.

   The bysetpos allows a list of values that corresponds to the nth occurance
   within the set of recurrence instances to be specified. For example, in a "monthly"
   recurrence rule, the byday parameter specifies every Monday of the week, the
   bysetpos with value of "-1" represents the last Monday of the month.
   Not setting the bysetpos parameter represents every Monday of the month.

   The wkst parameter allows to specify the day on which the week starts. This is
   significant when a "weekly" recurrence rule has an interval greater than 1, and
   a byday parameter is specified. This is also significant when in a "yearly" rule
   and a byyearweek is specified. The default value is "monday".

### Examples

   The following subsections provide some examples to illustrate the use of the period and recurrence formats defined as
   YANG groupings. Only the message body is provided with JSON used for encoding {{?RFC7951}}.

#### Period of Time

   The example of a period that starts at 08:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 2023 and ends at 18:00:00 UTC
   on December 31, 2025 is encoded as follows:

~~~~
{
  "period-of-time": {
    "period-start": "2023-01-01T08:00:00Z",
    "explicit-end": "2025-12-01T18:00:00Z"
  }
}
~~~~

   An example of a period that starts at 08:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 2023 and lasts 15 days and
   5 hours and 20 minutes is encoded as follows:

~~~~
{
  "period-of-time": {
    "period-start": "2023-01-01T08:00:00Z",
    "duration": "P15DT05:20:00"
  }
}
~~~~

   Now, consider the example of a period that starts at 08:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 2023 and lasts 20 weeks:

~~~~
{
  "period-of-time": {
    "period-start": "2023-01-01T08:00:00Z",
    "duration": "P20W"
  }
}
~~~~

#### Recurrence Rule

  The following snippet can be used to indicate a daily recurrent in December:

~~~~
{
  "recurrence": {
    "freq": "daily",
    "byyearmonth": [12]
  }
}
~~~~

   The following snippet can be used to indicate 10 occurrences that occur every last Saturday of the month:

~~~~
{
  "recurrence": {
    "freq": "monthly",
    "count": 10,
    "byday": [
      {
        "direction": [-1],
        "weekday": "saturday"
      }
    ]
  }
}
~~~~

   The following indicates the example of a recurrence that occurs on the last workday of the month until December 25, 2023:

~~~~
{
  "recurrence": {
    "freq": "monthly",
    "until": "2023-12-25",
    "byday": [
      { "weekday": "monday" },
      { "weekday": "tuesday" },
      { "weekday": "wednesday" },
      { "weekday": "thursday" },
      { "weekday": "friday" }
    ],
    "bysetpos": [-1]
  }
}
~~~~


   The following indicates the example of a recurrence that occurs every other week on Tuesday and Sunday, the week starts from Monday:

~~~
{
  "recurrence": {
    "freq": "weekly",
    "interval": 2,
    "byday": [
      { "weekday": "tuesday" },
      { "weekday": "sunday" }
    ],
    "wkst": "monday"
  }
}
~~~


##  The UCL Extension to the ACL Model

   This module specifies an extension to the IETF ACL model {{!RFC8519}} to add
   endpoint groups so that an endpoint group index can be matched upon, and also
   enable access control policy activation based on date and time conditions.

   {{ucl-tree}} provides the tree structure of the "ietf-ucl-acl" module.

~~~~
{::include ./yang/ietf-ucl-acl-tree.txt}
~~~~
{: #ucl-tree title="UCL Extension" artwork-align="center"}

   The first part of the data model augments the "acl" list in the
   IETF ACL model {{!RFC8519}} with a "endpoint-groups" container
   having a list of "endpoint group" inside, each entry has a group-id that uniquely
   identifies the endpoint group. The choice statement allows for the selection
   of group type between "user-group" or "device-group".

   The second part of the data model augments the "matches" container in the IETF
   ACL model {{!RFC8519}} so that a source and/or destination endpoint group index
   can be referenced as the macth criteria.

   The third part of the data model augments the "ace" list in the IETF ACL
   model {{!RFC8519}} with date and time specific parameters to allow ACE to be
   activated based on a date/time condition. Two types of time range are defined,
   which reuses "recurrence" and "period" groupings defined in the "ietf-schedule"
   YANG model, respectively. Note that the data model augments the definition of
   "recurrence" grouping with a "duration" data node to specify the duration of
   time for each occurance the policy activation is triggered.

# User Access Control Group ID RADIUS Attribute {#sec-radius}

   The User-Access-Group-ID RADIUS attribute and its embedded TLVs are
   defined with globally unique names.  The definition of the attribute
   follows the guidelines in Section 2.7.1 of {{!RFC6929}}.  This attribute
   is used to indicate the user group ID to be used by the NAS.  When
   the User-Access-Group-ID RADIUS attribute is present in the RADIUS
   Access-Accept, the system applies the related access control to the
   users after it authenticates.

   The value fields of the Attribute are encoded in clear and not
   encrypted as, for example, Tunnel- Password Attribute {{?RFC2868}}.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute is of type "string" as defined in
   Section 3.5 of {{!RFC8044}}.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Access-
   Accept packet.  It MAY also appear in a RADIUS Access-Request packet
   as a hint to the RADIUS server to indicate a preference.  However,
   the server is not required to honor such a preference.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS CoA-Request
   packet.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute MAY appear in a RADIUS Accounting-
   Request packet.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute MUST NOT appear in any other
   RADIUS packet.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute is structured as follows:

~~~~
   Type

      241

   Length

      This field indicates the total length, in octets, of all fields of
      this attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      "Value".

   Extended-Type

      TBA1

   Value

      This field contains the user group ID.

   The User-Access-Group-ID Attribute is associated with the following
   identifier: 241.TBA1.

#  RADIUS Attributes

   The following table provides a guide as what type of RADIUS packets
   that may contain User-Access-Group-ID Attribute, and in what

# Security Considerations

##  YANG

   The YANG modules specified in this document defines schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF {{!RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{!RFC8040}}.  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) {{!RFC6242}}.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   {{!RFC8446}}.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The "ietf-schedule" module defines a set of types and
   groupings.  These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules.  The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that
   are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As
   such, there are no additional security issues related to the "ietf-
   schedule" module that need to be considered.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the "ietf-ucl-acl" YANG module that are
   writable, creatable, and deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes
   could have a negative effect on network and security operations.

   * TBC
   * TBC

    Some of the readable data nodes in the "ietf-ucl-acl" YANG module may
    be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It
    is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
    or notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data
    nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

    *  <list subtrees and data nodes and state why they are sensitive>
    *  <list subtrees and data nodes and state why they are sensitive>

##  RADIUS

   RADIUS-related security considerations are discussed in {{!RFC2865}}.

   This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in
   place between the RADIUS client and server with communication
   optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   {{?RFC6614}}.

# Examples Usage

## Configuring the Controller Using Group based ACL {#controller-ucl}

   Let's consider an organization that would like to restrict the access of R&D
   employees that bring personally owned devices (BYOD) into the workplace.

   The access requirements are as follows:

   * Permit traffic from R&D BYOD of employees, destined to R&D employees'
     devices every work day from 8:00 to 18:00.

   * Deny traffic from R&D BYOD of employees, destined to finance servers
     located in the enterprise DC network starting at 8:30:00 of January 20,
     2023 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC (Pacific Standard Time) and ending
     at 18:00:00 in Pacific Standard Time on December 31, 2023.

   The following example illustrates the configuration of the SDN controller
   using the group-based ACL:

~~~~
{::include-fold ./examples/controller-ucl.xml}
~~~~

## Configuring a PEP Using Group based ACL {#PEP-ucl}

   This section illustrates an example to configure a PEP  using
   the group-based ACL.

   The PEP which enforces group-based ACL may acquire group identities
   from the AAA server if working as an NAS authenticating both the
   source endpoint and the destination endpoint users. Another case for
   a PEP enforcing a group-based ACL is to obtain the group identity of
   the source endpoint directly from the packet field
   {{?I-D.smith-vxlan-group-policy}}. This example does not intend to be exhaustive.

   Assume the mapping between device group ID and IP addresses is
   predefined or acquired via device authentication. The following example
   shows ACL configurations delivered from the controller to the PEP. This
   example is consistent with the example presented in {{controller-ucl}}.

~~~~
{::include-fold ./examples/PEP-ucl.xml}
~~~~

## Configuring the PEP Using Address based ACL {#PEP-acl}

   The section illustrates an example of configuring a PEP using
   IP address based ACL. IP address based access control policies could
   be applied to the PEP that may not understand the group information,
   e.g., firewall.

   Assume an employee in the R&D department accesses the network
   wirelessly from a non-corporate laptop using IP address 192.168.1.10.
   The SDN controller associates the user group to which the employee
   belongs with the user address according to step 1 to 4 in {{overview}}.

   Assume the mapping between device group ID and IP addresses is
   predefined or acquired via device authentication. The following
   example shows IPv4 address based ACL configurations delivered from
   the controller to the PEP. This example is consistent with the example
   presented in {{controller-ucl}}.

# Changes between Revisions

  v01 - v02

  *  Add more examples.


   v00 - v01

   *  Define a common schedule yang module and reuse in UCL yang module
      to support time/date-based activation condition.

   *  Either group-based or address-based ACL policies could be enforced
      at PEP, and allow group-based ACL policies maintained at the
      network controller.

   *  Optimize the process in section 4.1.

   *  Extend ACL module to support a generalized endpoint-group to cover
      both end users (e.g., enterprise employees) and enterprise hosts
      (e.g., IoT devices or servers);

   *  Simplify the definition of group in UCL model with only the most
      necessary group ID retained.
